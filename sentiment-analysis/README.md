## **Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face Transformers**

#### **Description**

We are going to focus on natural language processing (NLP) for building conversational AI agents. We will use Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library to implement a sentiment analysis agent that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative. The agent uses a pretrained DistilBERT model that we will fine-tune on a small synthetic dataset The goal is to demonstrate transformer-based text classification.

#### **Concepts Covered**

**Transformer Models:** Neural networks using attention mechanisms for NLP tasks.
**Hugging Face Transformers:** Library for pretrained models and tokenizers.
**Text Classification:** Assigning labels (e.g., positive/negative) to text inputs.
**Fine-Tuning:** Adapting a pretrained model to a specific task with minimal data.

#### **Files**

**sentiment_analysis.py:** Python script to fine-tune and test a DistilBERT model for sentiment analysis.

#### **Instructions**

**Install dependencies:** pip install transformers datasets torch numpy
Run sentiment_analysis.py to train and test the sentiment analysis agent.
Experiment with more reviews or adjust num_train_epochs for better performance.
