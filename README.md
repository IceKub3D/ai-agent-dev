## **AI Agent Development Learning Path**

This repository documents my AI agent learning path. It covers neural networks, reinforcement learning (RL), natural language processing (NLP), and popular frameworks like TensorFlow, Stable-Baselines3, and Hugging Face. Each subdirectory includes a description of the task at hand and code. I have found out that without necessary resources, training AI agents takes an awfully long time, so I did not include the results of running some of these tasks.

#### **Structure**

**subdirectory/:** Contains a README.md with task description and concepts, plus code files.
**requirements.txt:** Lists dependencies for all tasks.

#### **Projects Completed**

- Sentiment analysis using Hugging Face Transformers (DistilBERT).
- Conversational chatbot with Rasa with support for terminal and web interface interactions


#### **Setup**

**Clone the repo:** git clone https://github.com/IceKub3D/ai-agent-dev.git
**Install dependencies:** pip install -r requirements.txt
Navigate to a projectâ€™s folder (e.g., Sentiment Analysis) and follow its README.md instructions.
